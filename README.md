Developed a Library Management System  using Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), MySQL for the database, and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) for handling image processing. The project aims to create a simple, functional interface for managing a library's collection of books, including features for logging in, adding, viewing, and removing books.
